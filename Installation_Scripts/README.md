For installing Caffe on TX2, we have combined procedures from: https://github.com/jetsonhacks/installCaffeJTX2 and https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Ubuntu-14.04-VirtualBox-VM

The first does not make pycaffe. Hence we need to follow the procedure from the second link as well. While installing python requirements, make sure dateutil is installed/updated first and then update others.
